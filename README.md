# Gladiathor
A 2D Survival horde action (Unity & C#)

This is a 2D survival horde action game heavily inspired by the thrilling gameplay of Vampire Survivors. Developed using Unity and C#, this project served as a fantastic learning experience in 2D game mechanics and UI control.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained valuable insights into:

* Working with Unity and C# for game development
* Implementing core 2D mechanics like player movement, collision detection, and enemy AI
* Designing and integrating a simple yet functional UI
